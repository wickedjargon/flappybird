# Ignore generated assets inside android/build (these are copies of project files)

# Ignore generated resources (optional, but good for cleanliness)
# The `godot_project_name_string.xml` files are regenerated on export.
# However, modifying `res/values/strings.xml` or `styles.xml` is common for custom builds.
# For now, let's keep `res/` but ignore `bin/` or `gen/` if they existed (they don't in Gradle structure).

# Ignore .godot folders recursively (inside android/ too)
.godot/
android/build/**/.godot/
